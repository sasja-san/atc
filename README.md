# Getting Started

## Roms Needed

```{.txt}
$ sha1sum rom/*
4f36e459b6d2472c403a008a61140377a6c53229  atc.nds
24f67bdea115a2c847c8813a262502ee1607b7df  bios7.bin
```

Use the USA rom of Air Traffic Chaos.

In order to properly make an NDS rom its encryption needs to be correct.
This is solved by using an ARM 7 bios file from a DS or DSi.
